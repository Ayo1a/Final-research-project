# File Structure and Description  

This project is organized into a structured set of files and folders to facilitate navigation and understanding. Below is a breakdown of the files and their purposes:  

## Files  

1. **`README.md`**  
   - **Project overview**: Serves as the central overview of the project. It explains the purpose, methodologies, and key takeaways of the project. This file is displayed as the main page of the repository.  

2. **`Code Description for IIM Model.md`**  
   -  Provides a detailed explanation of the `iim_model.py` code. It includes descriptions of the implemented methods, the mathematical background, and usage instructions.  

3. **`Graph Generation Process.md`**  
   -  It explains the various options available (cloning, anticloning, alternating, and probabilistic methods) and showcases examples of graph evolution.  

4. **`iim_model.py`**  
   - The main Python script containing the implementation of the Iterative Independent Model. It includes methods for graph generation, spectral gap calculation, Laplacian computation, and visualization.  

5. **`results_and_conclusions.md`**  
   - Summarizes the results of the simulations, including spectral gap analysis, graph connectivity, and robustness. It also includes interpretations of findings and conclusions.  

6. **`example of different graphs/`**  
   - A folder containing images showcasing examples of graphs generated during the project. It includes graphs from different options (cloning, anticloning, alternating, probabilistic) and various iteration counts.  

7. **`images/`**  
   - **Description**: A folder that stores all visual assets, such as heatmaps of adjacency matrices, degree matrices, Laplacian matrices, and spectral gap distributions.

8. **`More graphs from the simulation`** 
   - This file contains additional visualizations of graphs generated during the simulation.

9. **`Expander-Mixing Lemma.md`** 
   - This file provides a detailed explanation of the Expander-Mixing Lemma, its relevance to the project, and how it supports the analysis of IIM graphs as models of real-world networks.

10. **`Results of Laplacian Matrices.md`** 
      - This file contains explanations and visualizations of the Laplacian matrix calculations, including how they are derived from the graph's adjacency and degree matrices.

11. **`More graphs from the simulation`** 
      - This file presents the concept of a hybrid model inspired by the IIM and Barabási–Albert models. It discusses how the model integrates features like heavy-tail degree distributions and small-world properties to             enhance the representation of social networks.
