# Results of the Various Matrices in the Laplacian Calculation

This document presents the results of the Laplacian matrix calculations generated by running the IIM model code. The matrices analyzed include the adjacency matrix, degree matrix, normalized Laplacian matrix, and spectral gap. 
These results are fundamental to understanding the structural the Laplacian Calculation. 

## Matrices Overview

### 1. **Adjacency Matrix (A)**
The adjacency matrix represents the connections between nodes in the graph:
- A value of `1` indicates an edge exists between two nodes.
- A value of `0` indicates no edge exists.

### 2. **Degree Matrix (D)**
The degree matrix is a diagonal matrix where each diagonal entry represents the degree of the corresponding node in the graph:
- Node degrees are calculated as the sum of edges connected to each node.

### 3. **Normalized Laplacian Matrix (L)**
The normalized Laplacian matrix is defined as:

Where \( I \) is the identity matrix, \( A \) is the adjacency matrix, and \( D \) is the degree matrix

This matrix is critical for analyzing graph properties, such as connectivity and clustering.

### 4. **Spectral Gap**

- **Spectral Gap:** \( ùúÜ = 0.7950732294021161 \)
The spectral gap is bounded away from zero and remains less than 1. This indicates that while IIM graphs are not poor expanders, they are also not exceptionally strong expanders.
This characteristic aligns well with the behavior typically observed in social networks and provides insights into:
- Graph connectivity.
- Expansion properties.
- Clustering behavior.

## Observations

- Graphs generated by the IIM model exhibit diverse adjacency and degree matrices.
- The normalized Laplacian matrix and spectral gap values confirm varying connectivity and clustering patterns.
- These variations align with the theoretical expectations of IIM graphs and their resemblance to real-world network structures.
