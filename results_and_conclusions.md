# Results and Conclusions 

In this document, we summarize the results of the Iterative Independent Model (IIM) graph simulation and present conclusions drawn from the analysis. The simulations were conducted with various options for graph generation, and key metrics such as spectral gap, graph diameter, and connectivity were evaluated.

## Graph Generation Process

We explored four different options for graph generation:

1. **Cloning every vertex** 
2. **Anticloning every vertex** 
3. **Alternating between cloning and anticloning** 
4. **Probabilistic cloning and anticloning (with probability `p`)**

## Mathematical background:
- A deeper understanding of the spectral gap's implications and its connection to clustering and network resilience is crucial to determining whether our findings support or contradict the article's assertions. By refining and analyzing the model, we strive to gain meaningful insights into the behavior of IIM graphs in this context.
  
- The article asserts that the graphs generated by IIM have a spectral gap of the graph's Laplacian matrix is bounded away from zero. This property suggests that these graphs exhibit strong clustering and robustness, making them more representative of social networks than randomly generated graphs. It is important to note that the article emphasizes that IIM graphs are less expansive compared to other random graphs, making them more reflective of the characteristics of social networks. In essence, IIM graphs strike a balance: they are moderately good expanders but not excessively so. This property aligns with the expectation of a spectral gap that is bounded away from 0 but still will be small. It also property implies that the graph has a small diameter, meaning the number of steps between any two vertices is minimized.
  
- But how much is bounded away and what are its borders?
Lets analyze the range of eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix![](https://github.com/Ayo1a/Final-research-project/blob/main/images/Laplacian.PNG), denoted by ùúÜ (the spectral gap). This matrix is derived using the rank matrix D, adjacency matrix A, and unit matrix I.
![see here the results of the various matrices in the Laplacian calculation created by running the code](https://github.com/Ayo1a/Final-research-project/blob/main/Results%20of%20Laplacian%20Matrices.md)
- The spectral gap ùúÜ of (L) is defined by![](https://github.com/Ayo1a/Final-research-project/blob/main/images/spectral%20gap.PNG), the difference between the eigenvalues ‚Äã‚Äãat the edges of the graph's Laplacian matrix. 
and the range of Laplacian matrix eigenvalues is ![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbd49990-498c-4bb5-8e50-e847ffacb4f5)

ùúÜ cannot equal zero because, in that case, both ùúÜ1 and ùúÜùëõ‚àí1 would be equal to 1. This scenario corresponds to a fully connected graph where every vertex is connected to itself, a structure that the IIM model does not generate.
- On the other hand, ùúÜ!=1 because this results in two possibilities: either ùúÜ1=0, indicating the graph is disconnected, or ùúÜùëõ‚àí1=2, signifying the graph is bipartite. Both of these assumptions follow from the definition of a well-extended graph.
In our case, the assertion is that IIM graphs are connected, and neither of these scenarios aligns with the expected properties of the model.
- The range of ùúÜ is [0,1], and based on the expectations described earlier, we anticipate a value close to 1.

The research's claim that IIM graphs have properties more similar to social networks (with ùúÜ abounded away from zero), rests on the Expander-Mixing lemma. 

![](https://github.com/Ayo1a/Final-research-project/blob/main/images/lemma%203.1.PNG).

The Expander-Mixing Lemma offers a theoretical basis for understanding how the structural properties of IIM graphs align with attributes of real-world networks give a lower bound on the spectral gap of any IIM grapg which is 1/15 (0.06666666666). If the spectral gap ùúÜ is different from zero (indicating that the graph is not a highly expansive, regular random graph), the resulting from the lemma is graphs exhibit varying numbers of edges. Some graphs are strong expanders, while others are less so. This diversity better simulates the complex, heterogeneous nature of real-world networks, such as social networks, where connectivity patterns are far from uniform and exhibit varied clustering and expansion behaviors. ![For a detailed explanation, refer to this section.](https://github.com/Ayo1a/Final-research-project/blob/main/Expander-Mixing%20Lemma.md)

## Results

### Example Graphs - 
We will examine the graph created from option 4 (Probabilistic cloning or anticloning based on a probability p = 0.6) and 3 steps with initial state of 2 connected nodes (option a).

### Observations from the creation of the Laplacian matrix ![Link]((https://github.com/Ayo1a/Final-research-project/blob/main/Results%20of%20Laplacian%20Matrices.md))

- Graphs generated by the IIM model exhibit diverse adjacency and degree matrices.
- The normalized Laplacian matrix and spectral gap values confirm varying connectivity and clustering patterns.
- These variations align with the theoretical expectations of IIM graphs and their resemblance to real-world network structures.

### Spectral Gap Analysis

We ran the simulation 20 times (within the limitations of the runtime) and calculated the spectral gap for each run. As we can see The average spectral gap is calculated as follows:

- **Average Spectral Gap**: Average spectral gap over 20 runs: 0.7950732294021161

#### Spectral Gap Distribution

**Description**: The plot shows the distribution of spectral gaps over 20 runs. This helps to understand how the spectral properties of the graph vary across different simulations.

## Conclusions

The results from the simulation show the following:

- The graph's spectral gap is closely related to the graph structure, and a higher spectral gap will indicate better connectivity.
- We obtained results (within the limitations of the computational model) that align with the article's assertions. The spectral gap, measured as 0.7950732294021161, is bounded away from zero and remains less than 1. This indicates that while IIM graphs are not poor expanders, they are also not exceptionally strong expanders. This characteristic aligns well with the behavior typically observed in social networks.
- We also found bound on the spectral within the limitations of the computational model
- Alternating cloning and anticloning introduce a unique balance between density and sparsity in the graph structure. **For more graphs from the same simulation looks here:** ![more graphs from the this simulation](https://github.com/Ayo1a/Final-research-project/blob/main/more%20graphs%20from%20the%20simulation.md)
- The probabilistic approach introduces variability, which can lead to graphs with more varied spectral gaps.
- We can say that according to our simulation, the IIM model's ability to model social networks and clustering behavior was evident from the graph structure and spectral properties.
